# A UI5 template provided by featureCLI

This UI5 application/library template is generated by a configuration of the featureCLI tooling.

## What makes this so special?
featureCLI uses feature-oriented programming (FOP) to create the UI5 templates.
Therefore it implements a plugin-structured architecture to support different languages.
For UI5 it uses Plugins for: 
- XML
- JSON
- JavaScript/ECMA Script

to generate the complete code out of fragments/features.
But all exists within one codebase.

**No ZIPs and fixed Coding are used!**

## Questions?
Don't frightened to ask the developers ;)
